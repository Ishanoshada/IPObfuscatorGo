## Code Magic

Our code is your secret spellbook for IP address manipulation:

### 🔍 Validating IP

The `isValidIP` function plays detective, making sure your IP is valid, with each segment perfectly in the 0 to 255 range.

### 🪄 Obfuscating IP

The `obfuscateIP` function is your magic wand. It transforms a valid IP into various enchanting versions:

- 💥 **Bitwise Blast:** Convert it using bitwise operations.
- 🔮 **Hex Hexation:** Change it to hexadecimal charm.
- 🌟 **Octal Enchantment:** Behold it in its octal aura.
- 🚀 **Hex Hexcellent:** Or wield it with an 8-character hexadecimal hex.

### 🚀 Running the Program

Enter an IP, and witness the magic unfold as it reveals the original and obfuscated IP addresses.
